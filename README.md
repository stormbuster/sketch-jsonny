# Jsonny

This Sketch plugin is a modifcation of json-parser by Koen Vendrik. It duplicates a template artboard with layer names matching the keys in a JSON file, with the amount of objects. Great if you need to take the entries from a research exercise and transfer them to nicely designed card templates in Sketch. 

The foundation of this plugin is built using SKPM, to ensure it works with the latest versions of Sketch.
